## Kotlin Syntax :
=> 
  Example:
    fun main() {
    println("Hello World")
  }

Example explained: **Tha fun keyword is used to declare a function.
A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
In the example above,it declares the main() function.

**The main() function is something you will see in every Kotlin program. 
This function is used to execute code. Any code inside the main() function's curly brackets {} will be executed.

**For example, the println() function is inside the main() function,
 meaning that this will be executed. The println() function is used to output/print text, 
 and in our example it will output "Hello World".

 ***Good To Know: In Kotlin, code statements do not have to end with a semicolon (;) (which is often required for other programming languages, such as Java, C++, C#, etc.).




 ## Kotlin Comments :
 =>Comments can be used to explain Kotlin code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.
  
  **Single-line comments =>

    Single-line comments starts with two forward slashes (//).
    Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Kotlin (will not be executed).
    This example uses a single-line comment before a line of code:

    Example:
    // This is a comment
    println("Hello World") 


  **Multi-line Comments =>

    Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
    Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Kotlin.
    This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

    Example:
    /* The code below will print the words Hello World
    to the screen, and it is amazing */
    println("Hello World")
