## Kotlin Syntax :
=> 
  Example:
    fun main() {
    println("Hello World")
  }

Example explained: **Tha fun keyword is used to declare a function.
A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
In the example above,it declares the main() function.

**The main() function is something you will see in every Kotlin program. 
This function is used to execute code. Any code inside the main() function's curly brackets {} will be executed.

**For example, the println() function is inside the main() function,
 meaning that this will be executed. The println() function is used to output/print text, 
 and in our example it will output "Hello World".

 ***Good To Know: In Kotlin, code statements do not have to end with a semicolon (;) (which is often required for other programming languages, such as Java, C++, C#, etc.).
